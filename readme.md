# SMART STEAM

For people with slow internet like me who want to download games when you are not near your PC doing some work.

Currently the script is simply setting download speeds by being hardcoded values. Goal is to detect when the pc is active and limit the download speed to a slow speed when working and to remove the limits when it is not being used so downloads can finish faster

There are no additional packages used and it is being tested in windows only
The script is 100% vanilla python
